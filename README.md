GriddlerSolver
==============

A Java implementation of multiple algorithms to solve griddler puzzles. Several examples can be seen by running the code and typing in 1000,1001,1002,etc into row size. Contact me if you want to discuss any part of the code! Thanks to Cheol Lee for lots of help on the coding and the development of algorithms.
